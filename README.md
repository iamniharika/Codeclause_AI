- [Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob](#sentiment-analysis-using-textblob)
- [Handwriting Recognition System](#handwriting-recognition-system)

## Virtual Mouse using Hand Gesture Recognition

This project utilizes MediaPipe to create a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures. It allows users to interact with their computer without touching a physical mouse.

- **Technologies:** MediaPipe, OpenCV, Python
- **Features:**
  - Hand tracking
  - Gesture recognition
  - Mouse control (click, scroll, drag)

## Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob

This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using the TextBlob library. It analyzes the polarity and subjectivity of the text to determine the overall sentiment.

- **Technologies:** TextBlob, Python
- **Features:**
  - Sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Subjectivity analysis
  - Text preprocessing and cleaning

## Handwriting Recognition System

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to develop a handwriting recognition system. It can recognize and classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.

- **Technologies:** TensorFlow, Keras, Python
- **Features:**
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
  - Handwritten digit classification
  - Model training and evaluation
